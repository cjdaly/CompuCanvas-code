/**
 * Common interface for components that can execute Neo4j statements.
 *
 * <h2>Important notes on semantics</h2>
 *
 * Statements run in the same {@link StatementRunner} are guaranteed
 * to execute in order, meaning changes made by one statement will be seen
 * by all subsequent statements in the same {@link StatementRunner}.
 *
 * However, to allow handling very large results, and to improve performance,
 * result streams are retrieved lazily. This means that when any of the
 * {@link #run(Statement)} methods return a result, the statement has only
 * started executing - it may not have completed yet. Most of the
 * time, you will not notice this, because the driver automatically
 * waits for statements to complete at specific points to fulfill its contracts.
 *
 * Specifically, the driver will ensure all outstanding statements are completed
 * whenever you:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Read from or discard a result, for instance via {@link StatementResult#next()},
 *     {@link StatementResult#consume()}.</li>
 *     <li>Explicitly commit a transaction using {@link Transaction#close()}</li>
 *     <li>Return a session to the pool using {@link Session#close()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * As noted, most of the time, you will not need to consider this - your writes will
 * always be durably stored as long as you either use the results, explicitly commit
 * {@link Transaction transactions} or return the session you used to the pool using
 * {@link Session#close()}.
 *
 * While these semantics introduce some complexity, it gives the driver the ability
 * to handle infinite result streams (like subscribing to events), significantly lowers
 * the memory overhead for your application and improves performance.

     * This method takes a set of parameters that will be injected into the

     * dangerous cypher injection attacks and improves database performance as
     * Neo4j can re-use query plans more often.
     *
     * This particular method takes a {@link Value} as its input. This is useful
     * if you want to take a map-like value that you've gotten from a prior result
     * and send it back as parameters.
     *
     * If you are creating parameters programmatically, {@link #run(String, Map)}
     * might be more helpful, it converts your map to a {@link Value} for you.
